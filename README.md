Hey welcome to my code!

For the best experience, press the open in new tab button and press F11 on your keyboard, or else the game may not function correctly.

If you are a tester or a 7-10 year old, I would just like to say Hey and thanks for testing out my game. It's good to see that you've taken the time to remember my game and come and have a look at it.

Unfortunately, my code is not open source and I do not grant anyone permission to use it unless you have an expressed written agreement that is signed by myself. This is due to the fact that this is an assessment piece. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to you.

I must give credit to my sources which are Canva for background (start, end, and help), OpenGameArt for in level backgrounds. For level 3 I have taken it from this link https://opengameart.org/content/toon-road-texture and have resized it (attribution to creator). OpenMoji and the kaboom Assets Lib for sprites / emojis. I have used music from www.davidcuttermusic.com â€” David Cutter for my intro. For my font I have used Evil Empire I have not made any changes to it and have taken it from https://www.dafont.com/evil-empire.font ((attribution to creator).

This code and The Lost Key Adventure is a creation made by Hamid.
